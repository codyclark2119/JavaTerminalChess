- R = "Reflect" / "Refactor"

<h2>1. Understanding the Problem</h2>
*I need to create a java based game
*that uses a lambda function, Interface,
*abstract class, and stream. Must 
*include a package and error handling.
*I would like to achieve at least the 
*bonus of adding a better visual design 
*than just ascii art.
*
<h2>
    2. Planning the Solution
</h2>
*I chose chess as my game as its a game im very familiar with
*and the base rules should be simple enough. I should
*make classes for the board (for tile structre/tracking),
*players (to track whos pieces are whos'), pieces (a general class for each specific piece
*to extend to show inheritance better), and individual piece classes. 
*I'm looking into libGDX as per calebs suggestion, the direct java
*integration looks cleaner than try to integrate react.
*
<h2>
    3. Executing the Plan
</h2>
*I set up the basic structure for the pieces through an abstract class as it'll be a perfect template for all of major pieces.
*After that i focused on creating and populating the board with spaces that can hold pieces. I started with the pawns as my first
*piece to make sure im moving them around on the board correctly and creating validation with the most basic movement before diving into the specialized movements.
*I created the main then and started by testing the movement and the move list tracking for checking for castling down the line.
